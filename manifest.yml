description: >
  Rhino Energy Prediction Plugin is designed to support architects in making energy-informed design decisions early in the building process. The plugin enables users to create or modify building models and receive predictions for heating and cooling loads using a machine learning (ML) model. Architects can gauge building energy performance early (concept stage) using the Rhino Energy Prediction Plugin. The plugin embeds a self-contained ONNX runtime directly in Grasshopper.
